/**
 * The OnCanStartGamePlayObserver receives notifications
 * and callbacks before a Scoreloop challenge is
 * started or accepted, and returns a boolean value 
 * indicating whether the gameplay can start or not. 
 *
 * Before a challenge begins or is accepted there are three
 * possible scenarios:
 * - there is no gameplay session underway,
 * - there is an existing gameplay session,
 * - there is an existing challenge underway.
 * 
 * ScoreloopUI keeps a record of
 * any challenges that are underway and
 * handles that scenario internally. However to 
 * find out whether there is already an ordinary gameplay session
 * underway, ScoreloopUI must communicate with the 
 * game application. The onCanStartGamePlay() method
 * will be notified and should be implemented by the 
 * developer according to the type of policy they
 * wish to execute:
 * - if there is an existing gameplay session,
 * cancel it and replace it with the challenge,
 * - if there is an existing gameplay session,
 * retain it and dismiss the challenge.
 *
 * Note that the observer must be correctly set in the
 * ScoreloopManager if 
 * the game supports challenges.
 *
 * Basic Usage:
 * -# Implement the onCanStartGamePlay() method.
 * -# Set the observer by calling 
 * ScoreloopManager.setOnCanStartGamePlayObserver(OnCanStartGamePlayObserver).
