# The version of your game (game version should be 1.0 or above)
game.version = 1.0

# If your game supports multiple modes specify the minimum and maximum modes 
# here. By default, every game has one mode. To add more modes, modify the 
# game.mode.max. Note that the maximum is not inclusive, (i.e. min=0, max=3
# defines modes 0, 1, and 2).
#game.mode.min = 0
#game.mode.max = 1

# In order to sort local scores, you have to provide a score comparator. 
# Possible values are ascending or descending (the default)
#game.score.comparator.result = ascending
#game.score.comparator.minorResult = ascending

# Your game-specific currency code (do not modify this)
currency.code = YZZ

# The currency symbol as it will appear in the UI (you may modify this).

# By default, ScoreloopUI enables access to the local device address book. This

# If this feature is disabled, you may also remove the READ_CONTACTS permission
# from the AndroidManifest.xml
#ui.feature.address_book = false

# Use this property to say if you want scoreloop to synchronize achievements
# with the server before you can access them. Set to false if you want to make
# achievements without this initial synchronization. (default is true)
#ui.feature.achievement.forceSync = false

# If you want to use the payment feature in the ui, you have to uncomment the following (default is false).
#ui.feature.payment = true

# This is the specification of the score formatter. Consult the ScoreFormatter 
# documentation for details.

# be output in the given screen. e.g. show score and level in the leaderboards
#ui.format.score.leaderboard = ScoreAndLevelFormat
#ui.format.score.challenges = LevelAndModeFormat
#ui.format.score.socialnetworkpost = DefaultFormat
