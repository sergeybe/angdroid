<p>Press '?' in the game for instructions.</p>

<p>Moving the trackball sends cursor keys to program (up, down, left,
right). Pressing the trackball sends an "enter" key.</p>

<p>Control keys can be entered by holding down the trackball followed by a
letter.</p>

<p>The escape key can be entered by pressing the back button.  You can
also enter an escape key by pressing Alt-w.</p>

<p>The screen is divided into a three by three grid for touch
input. Tapping in any of these grid areas sends the corresponding
keypad key (1-9) to the program. This can be useful for input of
diagonal directions.</p>

<p>Because of the lack of a full keyboard which the default keymap
requires for game play, I recommend switching to the rogue-like
keymap. This can be done through the program options (press =, a,
b). This keymap allows navigation in the eight directions though
keypresses (hjklyubn).</p>

<p>Pressing the home button on the phone will cause the program to go
into the background. The game will automatically be saved when this
happens, so you don't need to save the game first.</p>

<p>Internet/Location Permission: This program requires permission to
access the internet and to determine your location. This is used for
sending anonymous usage statistics to the developers. These statistics
will be used to help prioritize development tasks on this program in
the future.</p>
