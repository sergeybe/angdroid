<p>If you have problems using this program, please go to <a href="http://angdroid.org">angdroid.org</a> or <a href="mailto:david@angdroid.org">send email</a> to the developers.</p>

<p>If you report problems via feedback to the Android Market, we have no way to respond and address your issue.</p>

<p>Press '?' in the game for instructions.</p>

<p>Moving the trackball sends cursor keys to program (up, down, left,
right). Pressing the trackball sends an "enter" key.</p>

<p>Control keys can be entered by holding down the trackball followed by a
letter.</p>

<p>The escape key can be entered by pressing the back button.  You can
also enter an escape key by pressing Alt-w.</p>

<p>The screen is divided into a three by three grid for touch
input. Tapping in any of these grid areas sends the corresponding
keypad key (1-9) to the program. This can be useful for input of
diagonal directions.</p>

<p>Because of the lack of a full keyboard which the default keymap
requires for game play, I recommend switching to the rogue-like
keymap. This can be done through the program options (press =, a,
b). This keymap allows navigation in the eight directions though
keypresses (hjklyubn).</p>

<p>Pressing the home button on the phone will cause the program to go
into the background. The game will automatically be saved when this
happens, so you don't need to save the game first.</p>

<p>Angband 3.0.6 Borg:  This incredible Borg (automated Angband player)
is the work of Dr. A. P. White. If you play the Vanilla 3.0.6 version of 
Angband (this can be changed in preferences) the Borg is included for free.  
To activate him while playing, choose Control-z 
(i.e. Hold down trackball, followed by 'z').  The game will advise 
you that the Borg is dangerous and try to deny any responsibility 
for what is about to happen.  After reading and ignoring
these messages, type z at the "Borg Command:" prompt.  Now watch and
let your mind go numb!  To observe the Borg more closely, you can slow 
him down by entering the options menu (with the '=' key) and setting 
Base Delay Factor to a higher value.</p>

<p>Angband 3.0.6 Squelch:  The squelch system by Pete Mack has been
patched into this version of Angband 3.0.6.

<p>Internet/Location Permission: This program requires permission to
access the internet and to determine your location. This is used for
sending anonymous usage statistics to the developers. These statistics
will be used to help prioritize development tasks on this program in
the future.</p>
