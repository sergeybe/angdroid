<p>If you have problems using this program, please go to 
<a href="http://angdroid.org">angdroid.org</a> or 
<a href="mailto:support@angdroid.org">send email</a> to the developers.</p>

<p>If you report problems via feedback to the Android Market, 
we have no way to respond and address your issue.</p>

<p>Press '?' in the game for instructions.</p>

<br>
<p><b>The Game Screen:</b></p>
<p>A long press on the game screen will bring up a context menu for
changing the font size and enabling the virtual keyboard.  The volume
keys can also be used to change the font size.  The visible area can
be scrolled by dragging.</p>  
<p>The screen is divided into a three by three grid for touch
input. Tapping in any of these grid areas sends the corresponding directional key
to the program.  If "Always Run" is enabled in preferences, 
pressing shift before tapping the screen directional will
cancel the run behavior and move a single step. 
The behavior for tapping the grid area in the center of the 
screen is configurable and can be set to function as a
virtual Shift or Control key. 
</p>

<br>
<p><b>Virtual Keyboard:</b></p>
The virtual keyboard can be enabled through preferences or long press.
It has a numeric mode which has the number keys arranged for directional input.
The virtual keyboard also has a Control mode "^X" which sends Control keys.</p>

<br>
<p><b>Trackball/D-Pad:</b></p>
<p>By default, moving the trackball sends cursor keys to program (up, down, left,
right). Pressing the trackball once indicates that the next key should be
a Control key.  Pressing the trackball twice in a row
sends an "enter" key.  Control keys can also be entered by holding down the 
trackball followed by a letter.  
Control followed by a direction (or screen directional tap) will 
peform various in-game functions such as digging.
</p>

<br>
<p><b>Hardware Keyboard and Other Keys:</b></p>
<p>The Escape key can be entered by pressing the Back button.</p>

<p>Detailed hardware key mapping can be changed in preferences. When assigning 
hardware keys, the interface will ask you to press a hardware key.  If the key
you press was already assigned to another function, be aware that the original
function will now be unassigned. </p>

<p>If you configure your menu button for a function other than showing the menu, 
you will need to use a long screen press to access Preferences and other menu choices.
Hardware key mapping can be reset to the default configuration in preferences.</p>

<p>Pressing the home button on the phone will cause the program to go
into the background. The game will automatically be saved when this
happens, so you don't need to save the game first.</p>

<p>Because of the lack of a full keyboard which the default keymap
requires for game play, we recommend switching to the rogue-like
keymap. This can be done through the program options (press =, a,
b). This keymap allows navigation in the eight directions though
keypresses (hjklyubn).  </p>

<br>
<p><b>Angband Borg:</b></p>
<p>If you play the Vanilla 3.0.6 or 3.2.0 versions of 
Angband (this can be changed in preferences) a Borg (an automated
Angband player) is included for free.  
To activate him while playing, choose Control-z 
(i.e. Hold down trackball, followed by 'z').  The game will advise 
you that the Borg is dangerous and try to deny any responsibility 
for what is about to happen.  After reading and ignoring
these messages, type z at the "Borg Command:" prompt.  Now watch and
let your mind go numb!  To observe the Borg more closely, you can slow 
him down by entering the options menu (with the '=' key) and setting 
Base Delay Factor to a higher value.
Borgs are checkpoint saved every 5 minutes.
</p>

<br>
<p><b>Internet/Location Permission:</b></p>
<p>This program requires permission to
access the internet and to determine your location. This is used for
sending anonymous usage statistics to the developers. These statistics
will be used to help prioritize development tasks on this program in
the future.</p>

<br>
<p><b>Known Issues:</b></p>
<p>Changing game plugins often can cause memory usage to increase.  
Usually this is not a problem since the game automatically saves on exit.  
Android will kill the app if the memory footprint gets too large.</p>
<p>Running the Vanilla 3.2.0 borg currently leaks memory.
If you want to run the borg for long periods (i.e. overnight), the 3.0.6 borg is a more 
stable option at this time. 
<p>In Preferences, Hardware Key Mapping, there is a minor UI issue when assigning D-Pad
directional buttons.  You need to tap twice instead of once.
