/**
 * The AchievementsScreenActivity displays the awards that may 
 * be achieved in the game. It also shows whether the user has
 * achieved them. Awards that have been achieved are clickable. Clicking
 * an achieved award opens a dialog that enables the user to post
 * a message about the award to a social network. Awards must be configured on https://developer.scoreloop.com and the
 * awards bundle generated and added to your project. 
 * 
 * For the AchievementsScreenActivity to be available the scoreloop.properties
 * file must be configured correctly:
 * <table><tr><td>
 * @code
 *  ui.feature.achievement = true
 * @endcode
 * </td></tr></table>
 * 
 * Basic Usage:
 * -# Configure the scoreloop.properties file correctly.
 * -# Ensure that the ScoreloopManagerSingleton has been properly initialized.
 * -# Start the AchievementsScreenActivity using an <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html">android.content.Intent</a>.
